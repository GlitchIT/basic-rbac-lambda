# Super Simple Basic Role Based Access Control

## When to use
Simple no DB serverless api to allow signup and authentication of users. UUIDv4 based matching system. Whitelist based, block by default, intention is to keep always based on only allowing access if specifically given via a role.

## TODOs / Roadmap
* better/stronger matching
* increased security on checks
* better jwt/auth on signin
* admin portal for CRUD on roles/lists
* ?? possibly UI though that would probably be a separate lib
