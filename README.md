# Super Simple Basic Role Based Access Control

## When to use
Simple no DB serverless api to allow signup and authentication of users. UUIDv4 based matching system. Whitelist based, deny by default - the intention here is to only allow access if specifically given via a role.

## TODOs / Roadmap
* better/stronger matching
* increased security on checks
* better jwt/auth on signin
* admin portal for CRUD on roles/lists
* ?? possibly UI though that would probably be a separate lib
